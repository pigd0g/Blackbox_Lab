// Rotorflight's superpower is rotor-speed-linked filtering
// (harmonic notches that follow headspeed). This advisor
// closes the loop the spectrum opens:
//
//   1. find the vibration peaks (unfiltered gyro)
//   2. name their mechanical source via rotor harmonics
//   3. MEASURE how much of each peak the current filters
//      remove (unfiltered vs filtered gyro)
//   4. recommend, in plain language, what to change
//
// It never touches settings — it explains and points.
